This notebook sets up a complete data science pipeline applied to survival analysis and risk prediction: it begins with the installation and import of essential libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Lifelines, XGBoost), then loads and prepares the data (cleaning, handling missing values, variable selection). Next, it applies statistical survival models (such as the Cox model via lifelines) to analyse the time to an event (e.g. a medical emergency or critical risk), and in parallel, supervised machine learning models (logistic regression, decision trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to predict a risk score or probability. The data is separated into training and test sets, the models are trained, then evaluated using appropriate metrics (MAE, R², or performance scores). Finally, the results are used to prioritise the most urgent cases, combining statistical interpretability and the predictive power of machine learning, which makes this code particularly relevant for medical or decision-making applications in real-world contexts.
